# Circle Jump

Based on the original [Circle Jump](https://github.com/kidscancode/circle_jump) by [KidsCanCode](https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/games/circle_jump/index.html), and updated to Godot 4.2.2

 I revamped certain outdated elements entirely, such as the circular dial on limited circles, originally drawn manually, now replaced with a circular progress bar.

I also added features missing from the original, such as:

* Pause and resume
* Theme change
* Translation support

Check list:

- [x] Add pause and resume
  - [x] Timer before resume
- [x] Add theme change
- [x] Add translation support
- [x] Add updated Admob support
- [ ] Player profiles for high scores (maybe?)
